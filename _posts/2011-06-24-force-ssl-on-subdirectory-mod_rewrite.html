title: Force SSL connection on a subdirectory using mod_rewrite
---

<p>A while back I needed to force an SSL connection for only a subdirectory of a website. &nbsp;Apache's mod_rewrite came to my rescue.</p>

{% highlight apacheconf %}
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off # the following rules only apply if the connection isn't already HTTPS

# Next line captures any bits after the directory we're interested in
# and stuff it into %1, which gets expanded back out in the rule at the end
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /dir-that-needs-ssl/(.*)
RewriteRule / https://www.example.com/dir-that-needs-ssl/%1 [R,L]
{% endhighlight %}
