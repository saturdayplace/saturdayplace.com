			<blockquote>Trevor has done everything from updating my old website, designed me a newsletter, and recently rebuilt my website completely. He is great at taking my ideas and turning them into a reality that works.</blockquote>
			<cite>Holly DeVito &ndash; President/Owner, Sum of All Numbers</cite>
			<p>When bookkeeping firm Sum of All Numbers wanted to make their site easier to update, their SEO company asked if I could re-do it in WordPress.  It was also time for a re-design, so I designed a custom Wordpress theme based on the colors of their new logo.

			<blockquote>It's a genuine pleasure for me to recommend Trevor Hunsaker for his outstanding ability in taking my design and	making it into a fully-functional HTML website. In comparing my design to the live website they look identical in nearly every aspect save a few subtle differences in text that were caused by font limitations. I'm continually amazed by how 	accurately he was able to translate so many highly complex design elements into such a robust yet highly efficient HTML website.</blockquote> 
			<cite>Justin Howlett &ndash; Graphic Designer, Spillman Technologies</a></cite>
			<p>Spillman Technologies was updating all their marketing materials, and it was time to freshen up the website. In addition to implementing the designer's mockup, I built a custom system for the marketing department to easily update their website without needing to talk to a tech guy.</p>
