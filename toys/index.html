	<dt>SAA Feud - Backbone.js / Local Storage (Firefox Only)</dt>
	<dd><a href="feud/"><img src="/img/saaFeudLogo.png"></a>A game show interface I made for Spillman Technologies.  Uses Backbone.js for the interface and HTML5 
		localStorage to remember which questions had been asked during previous sessions (once a question is cleared, it won't re-appear
		unless you click the "Reset Game" button.  Originally this interface was
		designed to run on two monitors, one for the public scoreboard, and one for the admin backend.

	<dt>Let's Make a Deal - CSS Animations (Firefox Only)</dt>
	<dd><a href="deal/"> <img src="/img/deal.png"></a> Playing around with CSS animations and the JavaScript events they fire.  This was designed so that revealing each prize would
		only require the (unsophisticated) user to click once, play the entire reveal, and the reset for the next reveal.
